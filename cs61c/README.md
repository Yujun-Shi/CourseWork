## Course Project of CS61C



##1. About

I took the course cs61c during my visit to UCBerkeley in 2017 summer. According to the course policy of cs61c, I'm not allowed to release any of my work on the website, and that's why you see no code here :). But basically, we wrote a simple assembler, a simple linker, built a simple cpu with logisim, and had a lot of fun.
