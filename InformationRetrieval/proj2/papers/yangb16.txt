Abstract

This work focuses on dynamic regret of online
convex optimization that compares the perfor-
mance of online learning to a clairvoyant who
knows the sequence of loss functions in advance
and hence selects the minimizer of the loss func-
tion at each step. By assuming that the clairvoy-
ant moves slowly (i.e., the minimizers change
slowly), we present several improved variation-
based upper bounds of the dynamic regret under
the true and noisy gradient feedback, which are
optimal in light of the presented lower bounds.
The key to our analysis is to explore a regular-
ity metric that measures the temporal changes
in the clairvoyant’s minimizers, to which we re-
fer as path variation. Firstly, we present a gen-
eral lower bound in terms of the path variation,
and then show that under full information or gra-
dient feedback we are able to achieve an op-
timal dynamic regret. Secondly, we present a
lower bound with noisy gradient feedback and
then show that we can achieve optimal dynamic
regrets under a stochastic gradient feedback and
two-point bandit feedback. Moreover, for a se-
quence of smooth loss functions that admit a
small variation in the gradients, our dynamic re-
gret under the two-point bandit feedback matches
what is achieved with full information.

1. Introduction
Online convex optimization (OCO) can be deemed as a re-
peated game between an online player and an adversary, in
which an online player iteratively chooses a decision and
then her decisions incur (possibly different) losses by the
loss functions chosen by the adversary. These loss func-
tions are unknown to the decision maker ahead of time,
and can be adversarial or even depend on the action taken
by the decision maker. To formulate the problem mathe-
matically, let Ω ⊆ Rd denote a convex decision set (i.e.,
the feasible set of the decision vector), wt ∈ Ω denote the
decision vector and ft(·) : Rd → R denote the loss func-
tion at the t-th step, respectively. The goal of the online
t=1 ft(wt).
The traditional performance metric - the regret of the de-
cision maker, is deﬁned as the difference between the total
cost she has incurred and that of the best ﬁxed decision in
hindsight, i.e.,

learner is to minimize her cumulative loss(cid:80)T

Recently, there emerges a surge of interest (Besbes et al.,
2013; Hall & Willett, 2013; Jadbabaie et al., 2015) in the
dynamic regret that compares the performance of online
learning to a sequence of optimal solutions. If we denote by
t ∈ Ω an optimal solution of ft(w), the dynamic regret

is deﬁned as

advance, and hence selects the minimizer w∗
t at each step.
Compared to the traditional regret in (1) (termed as static
regret), the dynamic regret is more aggressive since the per-
formance of the clairvoyant in the dynamic regret model
is always better than that in the static regret model, i.e.,
t=1 ft(w). It was pointed out
that algorithms that achieve performance close to the best
ﬁxed decision may perform poorly in terms of dynamic re-
gret (Besbes et al., 2013).
Unfortunately, it is impossible to achieve a sublinear dy-
namic regret for any sequences of loss functions (c.f.
Proposition 1).
In order to achieve a sublinear dynamic
regret, one has to impose some regularity constraints on
the sequence of loss functions. In this work, we leverage a
notion of variation that measures how fast the clairvoyant
moves, i.e., how fast the minimizers of the sequence of loss
functions change, to which we refer as path variation in
order to differentiate with other variation deﬁnitions. For-
mally the path variation is deﬁned as

where Ω∗
t denotes the set of all minimizers of ft(w) to
account for the potential non-uniqueness. We aim to de-
velop optimal dynamic regrets when the clairvoyant moves
slowly given (noisy) gradient feedback (including bandit
feedback) for non-strongly convex loss functions. The
main results are summarized in Table 1 and the contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized below.

• We present a general lower bound dependent solely
on V p
T and show that under true gradient feedback for
smooth functions with vanishing gradients in the fea-
sible domain, one can achieve the optimal dynamic
regret of O(V p
T ) comparable to that with full informa-
tion feedback.

• We present a lower bound under a noisy (sub)gradient
feedback dependent on V p
T and T , and then show that
online gradient descent (OGD) with an appropriate
step size can achieve the optimal dynamic regret of
T T ) under both stochastic gradient feedback

O((cid:112)V p

and two-point bandit feedback.

• When the loss functions are smooth, we establish an
improved dynamic regret under the two-point bandit
feedback, which could match the bound achieved with
the full information feedback in a certain condition.

We note that a regularity metric similar to the path variation
(possibly measured in different norms) has been explored
in shifting regret analysis (Herbster & Warmuth, 1998) and
drifting regret analysis (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2012; Buch-
binder et al., 2012). The regret against the shifting ex-
perts was studied in tracking the best expert, where the

fact, a similar dynamic regret bound to(cid:112)V p

best sequence of minimizers are assumed to change for a
constant number of times. In drifting regret analysis, the
constraint is relaxed to that the path variation is small. In
T T has been
established for online convex optimization over the sim-
plex (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2012), where the path variation
is measured in (cid:96)1 norm. The present work focuses on OCO
in the Euclidean space and considers noisy gradient feed-
back. A more general variation is considered in (Hall &
Willett, 2013), where a sequence of (or a family of) dy-
namic models φ1, . . . , φT are revealed by the environment
for the learner to predict the decision in the next step. Their
t )(cid:107) for a
variation is deﬁned as V φ
sequence of comparators and their dynamic regret scales as
V φ
T , which is worse than our bounds when φt(w) = w.
T
There have been different notions of variation that measure
the point-wise changes in the sequence of loss functions
at any feasible points. For example, Besbes et al. (2013)
considered the functional variation deﬁned as
|ft(w) − ft+1(w)|.

Besbes et al. considered two feedback structures, i.e., the
noisy gradient and the noisy cost, and established sublinear
dynamic regret for both feedback structures. For Lipschitz
continuous loss functions, their results are presented in Ta-
ble 1 1. An annoying fact is that even the sequence of
Lipschitz loss functions change slowly (namely the func-
√
tional variation is small), Besbes’ dynamic regret is worse
than O(
In com-
parison, our results match that for static regret when the
clairvoyant moves slowly such that the path variation is a
constant. Another variation that measures point-wise dif-
ference between loss functions is the gradient variation in-
troduced in (Chiang et al., 2012), which is deﬁned as

The gradient variation has been explored for bounding the
static regret (Chiang et al., 2012; Rakhlin & Sridharan,
2013; Yang et al., 2014). Recently, Jadbabaie et al. (2015)
used the three variations and developed possibly better dy-
namic regret than using a single variation measure for non-
strongly convex loss functions. They considered the full
information feedback (i.e., the whole loss function is re-
vealed to the learner) and a true gradient feedback for a
sequence of bounded functions. Their results are also pre-
sented in Table 1. In comparison, our results could be po-
tentially better when the clairvoyant moves slowly. Dif-
ferent from (Jadbabaie et al., 2015), we consider the noisy

In this section, we present an optimal dynamic regret
bound dependent solely on V p
T and present algorithms with
matched upper bounds.

2.1. Preliminaries and a Lower Bound

Since it is impossible to achieve a sublinear dynamic re-
gret for any sequence of loss functions. We consider the
following family of functions that admit a path variation
constraint:

T ≤ BT}

Vp = {{f1, . . . , fT} : V p

(6)
where BT is the budget. For a (randomized) policy π
that generates a sequence of solutions w1, . . . , wT for a
sequence of loss functions f1, . . . , fT under the feedback
structure φ, its dynamic regret is deﬁned as

Note that the dynamic regret remains the same for different
sequences of optimal solutions w∗
Below, we establish a general lower bound of the dynamic
regret for the following family of policies:
A =

where φt(ft) ∈ Rk denotes any feedback of ft, and U ∈ U

Proposition 1. Let C, C1, C2 be positive constants inde-
T , and let π be any policy in A. (i) If

BT ≥ C1T , then there exists a positive constant C2 such
φ(Vp, T ) ≥ C2T. (ii) For any γ ∈ (0, 1), there ex-

Remark: The ﬁrst part indicates that it is impossible to
achieve a sublinear dynamic regret if there is no constraint
on the sequence of loss functions. Therefore, in the se-
quel, we only consider BT ≤ o(T ). A similar result to the
ﬁrst part using V f
T as the regularity measure has been es-
tablished (Besbes et al., 2013). The second part is novel,
which indicates that it is impossible to achieve a better dy-
namic regret bound of O((V p
T )α) with α < 1. If otherwise,
it then contradicts to the lower bound in the second part of
Proposition 1.

Proof. Fix T ≥ 1 and γ ∈ (0, 1). To generate the sequence
of loss functions, we create a sequence of random variables
ε1, . . . , εT , where each εt is sampled independently from
{σ,−σ} with equal probabilities. It is obvious that E[εt] =
0 and E[ε2
t ] = σ2. For each εt, we deﬁne a loss function
2 (w − εt)2. Assume σ ∈ (0, 1) whose value will

be speciﬁed later. Let the feasible domain be Ω = [−1, 1].

To prove the second part, we set σ = T −µ with µ =

f1, . . . , fT such that Rπ
We note that if γ = 1, we have µ = 0 and therefore BT =

Therefore, we restrict γ ∈ (0, 1).

An interesting question is that whether an O(V p
T ) dynamic
regret bound is achievable, if not what is the best we can
achieve. In particular, we are interested in scenarios when
the feedback φt(ft) = φt(wt, ft) only gives a (noisy) gra-
dient of ft(w) at wt. Before delving into the noisy gra-
dient feedback, we ﬁrst show that an O(V p
T ) upper bound
is achievable with full information of the loss functions or
with full gradient feedback provided that the loss functions
are smooth and have vanishing gradients. We make the fol-
lowing assumptions throughout the paper without explic-
itly mentioning it in the sequel.
Assumption 1. For {f1, . . . , fT} ∈ Vp, there exists a r >

0 such that supw∗

2.2. Online Learning with Full Information

Assume that at each step the full information of the loss
function ft(w) is revealed after the decision wt is submit-
ted, and each loss function ft(w) is G-Lipschitz continu-
ous. Then we can update wt+1 by

wt+1 = min

It is notable that a similar upper bound of O(max(V f

with the full information can be achieved (Jadbabaie et al.,
2015).

2.3. Online Learning with Gradient Feedback

Full information may not be available.
In practice, only
some partial information of the ft(w) regarding the de-
cision vector wt is available.
In this subsection, we as-
sume that only the gradient information ∇ft(wt) is avail-
able after the decision wt is submitted. Below, we will ﬁrst
present several examples showing that O(V p
T ) is achievable
and generalize the analysis to a broad family.
We consider two loss functions g1(w) = max(w, 0)2 and
g2(w) = (w − α)2 deﬁned in the domain Ω = [−1, 3] and
divide all iterations 1, . . . , T into a number m of batches
with each batch size of ∆T . Assume the adversary se-
lects g1(·) in odd batches and g2(·) in even batches, and
at each step the full gradient feedback is available, i.e.,
φt(wt, ft) = f(cid:48)
t(wt). The example is similar to that pre-
sented in (Besbes et al., 2013) except that g1(w) is not
strongly convex. Below, we consider two instances of the
above example with different ∆T and α. For the updates,
we adopt the OGD, i.e.,

t(wt)],

wt+1 = ΠΩ[wt − ηf(cid:48)

t = 1, . . . , T − 1
where ΠΩ[·] denotes the projection into the domain Ω.
Instance 1. ∆T = (cid:100)T /2(cid:101) and α = 1. Then V p
T = 1.
Given the value of ∆T , there are two batches. Let Γ1, Γ2 ⊆
T denote the iteration indices in the ﬁrst and the second
batch, respectively, and let Γj[1] denote the ﬁrst iteration
of the j-th batch. We adopt a constant step size η = 1/2
with a starting point w0 = 0. Then wt = 0, t ∈ Γ1. For the
ﬁrst iteration t ∈ Γ2 we have wt = ΠΩ[0 − ηg(cid:48)
1(0)] = 0.
And for all remaining iterations t ∈ Γ2, we have wt =
t , t ∈
ΠΩ[wt−1 − ηg(cid:48)
[T ] except wΓ2[1] = 0 (cid:54)= w∗
Γ2[1], which indicates that the
dynamic regret is fΓ2[1](wΓ2[1])−fΓ2[1](w∗
Γ2[1]) = g2(0)−
g2(1) = 1.

The example is similar to the above except that the loss
functions change more frequently. We consider OGD with
a constant step size η = 1/2 and w1 = 1. Similar as before,
we use j = 1, . . . , m to denote the batch index, Γj ⊆ T to
denote the indices in the j-th batch, Γj[1] and Γj[2 :] to
denote the ﬁrst iteration and remaining iterations in batch
j, respectively. Note that w∗
t =
α, t ∈ Γ2j.
For t ∈ Γ1[2 :] or t = Γ2[1], by induction we can show
that wt = ΠΩ[wt−1 − ηg(cid:48)
1(wt−1)] = 0. Therefore, wt =
t , t ∈ Γ1[2:] and wΓ2[1] = 0. For t ∈ Γ2[2:] or t = Γ3[1],

following the OGD update wt = ΠΩ[wt−1−ηg(cid:48)
2(wt−1)] =
ΠΩ[wt−1 − 2η(wt−1 − α)] = α. Therefore, wt = α, t ∈
Γ2[2:] and t = Γ3[1]. Following the same analysis, we have
t for t ∈ Γj[2:], wΓ2j−1[1] = α and wΓ2j [1] = 0.
wt = w∗
It means that the difference between the decision vector
wt and the optimal solutions w∗
t only happens at the ﬁrst
iterations of all batches. As a result, the dynamic regret is

It is notable the key ingredient to achieve an O(V p
T ) dy-
namic regret is to use a constant step size. Next, we gen-
eralize this result to a broad family of loss functions. In
particular, we assume the sequence of loss functions sat-
isfy the following assumption.
Assumption 2. Assume that every loss function ft(·) is
deﬁned over Rd and is convex and smooth, i.e., for any
w, w(cid:48) ∈ Rd, we have

(cid:107)∇ft(w) − ∇ft(w(cid:48))(cid:107)2 ≤ L(cid:107)w − w(cid:48)(cid:107)2,

t ∈ Ω∗

where L > 0 is the smoothness constant. In addition, we
assume that there exists w∗
t ) = 0.
The condition ∇ft(w∗
t ) = 0 is referred to as the vanishing
gradient condition. The examples considered before indeed
satisfy Assumption 2. Consider the policy of OGD:

t such that ∇ft(w∗

The following theorem states the dynamic regret bound of
OGD with a constant step size.

Remark: Theorem 3 exhibits that OGD can achieve an
O(max(V p
T , 1)) dynamic regret for a sequence of loss func-
tions in Vp that satisfy Assumption 2 with only the gradient
feedback, which is comparable to that achieved in the full
information feedback. The instance 1 and 2 in Section 2
has V p
T , respectively. There-
fore, using OGD with η = C we can obtain an O(1) and
O(

T = O(1) and V p

T ) dynamic regret.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the OGD with restarting
proposed in Besbes et al.’ work achieves an O(T 1/3) dy-
namic regret for instance 1 and an O(T 5/6) dynamic regret
for instance 2 due to that the functional variation for the
√
ﬁrst instance is bounded by a constant and for the second
instance is bounded by O(

T ).

3. Optimal Dynamic Regret with Noisy

Gradient

In this section, we focus on noisy gradient feedback, i.e.,
φt(wt, ft) is only a noisy (sub)gradient of ft(w) at wt.

3.1. A Lower Bound with Noisy Gradient Feedback

Before presenting the upper bounds of the dynamic regret
with noisy gradient feedback, we will ﬁrst present a lower
bound. For establishing the lower bound, we consider the
following class of policies

π : wt =

πt({φτ (wτ , fτ )}t−1

τ =1, U ),

t = 1
t ≥ 1

(10)

(cid:26) π1(U ),

Optimal Dynamic Regrets of Online Learning with True and Noisy Gradient

where U, π1, πt are deﬁned similarly as before, and
φt(wt, ft) is a noisy subgradient of ft at wt. In particu-
lar, we assume the noisy gradient is given by φt(wt, ft) ∈
∂ft(wt) + t with t satisfying the following condition.
Assumption 5. t ∈ Rd, t ≥ 1 are iid random vectors
with zero mean and covariance matrix Σ with bounded en-
tries such that tr(Σ) ≤ λ2. Let P (·) denote the cumulative
function of t. There exists a constant ˜C such that for any

(cid:16) dP (y)

(cid:17)

a ∈ Rd,(cid:82) log

dP (y) ≤ ˜C(cid:107)a(cid:107)2
2.

dP (y+a)

When the noise vectors are independent Gaussian random
vectors with zero mean and covariance matrices with en-
tries uniformly bounded by σ2, the above assumption is
satisﬁed with ˜C = 1/(2σ2) and λ2 = dσ2 (Besbes et al.,
2013).
Theorem 6. (lower bound) For any 1 ≤ BT ≤ T and κ ∈
(1/2, 1), there exist V(cid:48)
p ⊂ Vp and C(κ) > 0 independent of
T and BT such that for any policy π in (10) under the noisy
gradient feedback that satisﬁes Assumption 5, we have

Rπ
φ(V(cid:48)

p, T ) ≥ C(κ)Bκ

T T 1−κ.

Remark: Note that from the proof presented below when
κ → 1/2, C(κ) → 0. However, the above lower bound
can be used to argue that it is impossible to achieve a bet-
ter dynamic regret than O(B1/2
T T 1/2) with the noisy gradi-
ent feedback for any sequence of loss functions. We prove
this by contradiction.
In particular, assume there exists
an algorithm under the noisy gradient feedback achieves
better bound than O(B1/2
T T 1/2) for any sequence of loss
T T 1−α)
functions. We can consider two lower orders O(Bα
T T β) with α ≤ 1/2, β ≤
with 1 > α > 1/2 and O(Bα
T T 1−α)
1/2 and α + β < 1. First, we assume O(Bα
is achievable. By Theorem 6 we know that there exists
p, T ) ≥
φ(V(cid:48)
2 ) and V(cid:48)
α < κ < 1 (e.g., κ = α+1
T T 1−α), which yields a contradic-
Ω(Bκ
tion. To show that the second lower bound is unachievable,
T T β),
we can construct a BT such that Bκ
i.e., BT ≥ Ω(T

κ−α ), where β + κ − 1 < κ − α.

where 0 < δ < 1/2 and γ > 0 will be determined
later. It is easy to verify that both f (·) and g(·) are con-
vex but not strongly convex.
It is also easy to see that

f − x∗

the optimal solutions for f (·) and g(·) are x∗
f = δ and
g = −δ, respectively. Hence |x∗
g| = 2δ. For
x∗
a given budget BT , we will construct a subset of Vp by
only considering the sequence of these two loss func-
tions. For some ∆T ∈ {1, . . . , T} that, we divide the en-
tire sequence T into m = (cid:100)T /∆T(cid:101) batches, denoted by
T1, . . . ,Tm, each with size of ∆T (except perhaps Tm), i.e.
Tj = {(j − 1)∆T + 1, . . . , min(j∆t, T )}, j = 1, . . . , m.
To generate the sequence of loss functions f1, . . . , fT , at
the beginning of each batch Tj, we randomly choose be-
tween the two functions f (·) and g(·) and the same loss
function will be used throughout the batch. We denote by
V(cid:48)
p = {{ft(·), t = 1, . . . , T}} the set of a sequence of
randomly sampled loss functions, and by X1, . . . , XT the
sequence of solutions generated by any policy in (10). Let

In the next two subsections, we consider two types of noisy
gradient feedback, namely a stochastic subgradient feed-
back that is an unbiased estimation of the true subgradient
and a bandit feedback that gives an unbiased estimation of
the subgradient of a smoothed function instead of the orig-
inal function. We show that under the two noisy gradient
feedback, we are able to achieve an optimal dynamic re-
T T ). Furthermore, for smooth loss functions
under the two-point bandit feedback, we establish an even
better upper bound by leveraging the gradient variation in

ent variation is small matches the lower bound presented in

3.3. Online Learning with Bandit Feedback

In this subsection, we analyze the dynamic regret with ban-
dit feedback by building on previous work. Bandit feed-
back has been analyzed before for the static regret.
In
particular, using one-point bandit feedback Flaxman et al.
(2005) showed an O(T 3/4) static regret bound, while Agar-
√
wal et al. (2010) established an optimal static regret bound

of O(

Similar to previous work, we assume that ft(w) is G-
Lipschitz continuous and R1B ⊆ Ω ⊆ R2B where B =
{w ∈ Rd : (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≤ 1} is the unit ball centered at 0. Let
ut ∈ Rd be a random unit vector, ei ∈ Rd be the i-th
canonical vector, w1 = 0. For Lipschitz continuous loss
functions, the update is given by

wt+1 = Π(1−ξ)Ω[wt − ˆgt]

Remark: When the gradient variation is small such that

that a similar upper bound can be achieved for linear loss
functions by extending the static regret analysis in (Chiang
et al., 2013) to the dynamic regret similarly to the proof of
Theorem 9.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, we have considered dynamic regret for on-
line learning under true and noisy gradient feedback. We
have developed several lower and upper bounds of the dy-
namic regret based on the path variation that measures the
temporal changes in the optimal solutions. In light of the
presented lower bounds, the achieved upper bounds are op-
timal for non-strongly convex loss functions when the clair-
voyant moves slowly. An interesting question that remains
open is that what is the optimal dynamic regret bound for
strongly convex loss functions in terms of the path varia-
tion.
